 # EdTech Recorded Lectures Power BI Dashboard

## 📅 Project Overview
This project analyzes recorded lecture data collected from various EdTech platforms. The goal is to uncover trends and strategic insights related to course types, viewer engagement, language preferences, instructor ratings, skills taught, and course durations. A **Power BI Dashboard** was developed to visualize and present these insights in a clear, actionable way, helping EdTech startups optimize their offerings and grow effectively.

## 🔢 Problem Statement
An EdTech startup aims to expand its recorded lecture offerings. To do this, they need to:

- Examine the distribution of course types across categories to strategize future course launches.
- Analyze the average number of views across categories, sub-categories, and languages.
- Identify the most commonly taught skills across categories.
- Investigate the distribution of languages in recorded lectures.
- Determine language preferences for the top 5 categories based on viewer engagement.
- Assess the impact of subtitle availability on viewer engagement.
- Identify top-performing instructors by category and sub-category.
- Examine how course duration affects viewer engagement across categories and sub-categories.
- Understand whether the variety of skills offered impacts viewership.
